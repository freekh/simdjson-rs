# simdjson-rs

A rewrite of simdjson in rust.

The intention is to have as idiomatic rust code as possible 
so the high-level parsing algorithm is (more) easily readable.

Also this author just wants to hack a bit of rust while trying
to understand the algorithm...

Might not be possible (or be abandoned) - we shall see...

**STATUS**: Currently nothing is done yet.
